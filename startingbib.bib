              We present first results from James Webb Space Telescope Near-Infrared Spectrograph, Mid-Infrared Instrument, and Keck Cosmic Webb Imager integral field spectroscopy of the powerful but highly obscured host galaxy of the jetted radio source Cygnus A.

The density-stratified NLR appears to be shaped by the initial blow-out and ongoing interaction of the radio jet with the interstellar medium, creating a multiphase bicone with a layered structure composed of molecular and ionized gas. The NLR spectrum, with strong coronal emission at kiloparsec scale, is well modeled by active galactic nucleus photoionization. We find evidence that the NLR is rotating around the radio axis, perhaps mediated by magnetic fields and driven by angular momentum transfer from the radio jet.

            We examine Chandra observations of the powerful Fanaroff–Riley class II (FR II) radio galaxy Cygnus A for an X-ray counterpart to the radio transient Cygnus A-2 that was first detected in 2011. Observations are performed using the High-Resolution Camera (HRC) instrument in order to spatially resolve Cygnus A-2 and the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) at a separation of  0.′′42. Simulated images are generated of the emission region, and radial profiles for the region of interest are extracted. A comparison between the simulations and observations reveals no X-ray detection of Cygnus A-2 to a 0.5–7.0 keV flux upper limit of \$1.04 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-12\}{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}, erg{\textbackslash}, cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, or a rest-frame 2–10 keV luminosity of \$8.6{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{42\}{\textbackslash}rm {\textbackslash}, erg{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. We estimate the black hole mass of Cygnus A-2 based on our X-ray flux limit and find it to be consistent with a flaring black hole rather than a steadily accreting source. The HRC observations are additionally compared with archival Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) data from 2016 to 2017, and both the overall morphology and the flux limits of the AGN complex agree between the two data sets. This consistency is despite the pile-up effect in ACIS which was previously considered to bias the observed morphology of the AGN. The agreement between the data sets demonstrates the viability of utilizing the archival Chandra data of Cygnus A to analyse its AGN at an unprecedented level of precision.},

	abstract = {In 2015, a radio transient named Cygnus A-2 was discovered in Cygnus A with the Very Large Array. Because of its radio brightness (νFν ≈ 6 × 1039 erg s-1), this transient likely represents a secondary black hole in orbit around the active galactic nucleus. Using Chandra ACIS observations from 2015 to 2017, we have looked for an X-ray counterpart to Cygnus A-2. The separation of 0.42 arcsec means that Cygnus A-2 cannot be spatially resolved, but by comparing the data with simulated MARX data, we put an upper limit to the 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity of Cygnus A-2 of 1 × 1043 erg s-1. Using the Fundamental Plane for accreting black holes, we find that our upper limit to the X-ray flux of Cygnus A-2 in 2015-2017 disfavours the interpretation of Cygnus A-2 as a steadily accreting black hole. We suggest instead that Cygnus A-2 is the radio afterglow of a tidal disruption event (TDE) and that a peak in the 2-10 keV luminosity of the nuclear region in 2013, when it was observed by Swift and NuSTAR, is X-ray emission from the TDE. A TDE could naturally explain the X-ray light curve of the nuclear region, as well as the appearance of a short-lived, fast, and ionized outflow previously detected in the 2013 NuSTAR spectrum. Both the radio and X-ray luminosities fall in between typical luminosities for `thermal' and `jetted' TDE types, suggesting that Cygnus A-2 would be unlike previously seen TDEs.},

              We present a new framework for joint likelihood deconvolution (
              Jolideco
              ) of a set of astronomical observations of the same sky region in the presence of Poisson noise. The observations may be obtained from different instruments with different resolution, and different point-spread functions (PSFs).
              Jolideco
              reconstructs a single flux image by optimizing the posterior distribution based on the joint Poisson likelihood of all observations under one of several prior distributions. Most notably, we employ a patch-based image prior that is parameterized via a Gaussian mixture model, which we train on high-signal-to-noise astronomical images, including data from the JWST and the GLEAM radio survey. This prior favors correlation structures among the reconstructed pixel intensities that are characteristic of those observed in the training images. It is, however, not informative for the mean or scale of the reconstruction. By applying the method to simulated data, we show that the combination of multiple observations and the patch-based prior leads to much improved reconstruction quality in many different source scenarios and signal-to-noise regimes. We demonstrate that with the patch prior
              Jolideco
              yields superior reconstruction quality relative to alternative standard methods such as the Richardson–Lucy method. We illustrate the results of
              Jolideco
              applied to example data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. By comparing the measured width of a counts-based and the corresponding
              Jolideco
              flux profile of an X-ray filament in SNR 1E 0102.2–7219, we find the deconvolved width of 0.″58 ± 0.″02 to be consistent with the theoretical expectation derived from the known width of the PSF.},

              We report the appearance of a new radio source at a projected offset of 460 pc from the nucleus of Cygnus A. The flux density of the source (which we designate Cygnus A-2) rose from an upper limit of {\textless}0.5 mJy in 1989 to 4 mJy in 2016 (
              ν
              = 8.5 GHz), but is currently not varying by more than a few percent per year. The radio luminosity of the source is comparable to the most luminous known supernovae, it is compact in Very Long Baseline Array observations down to a scale of 4 pc, and it is coincident with a near-infrared point source seen in pre-existing adaptive optics and
              HST
              observations. The most likely interpretation of this source is that it represents a secondary supermassive black hole in a close orbit around the Cygnus A primary, though an exotic supernova model cannot be ruled out. The gravitational influence of a secondary SMBH at this location may have played an important role in triggering the rapid accretion that has powered the Cygnus A radio jet over the past 10

Scattered active galactic nucleus light provides a significant contribution to the total flux at 3800 Å (rest) of the western component, where the polarization rises to 16\%. The spatially integrated flux of Cygnus A at 5500 Å can be decomposed into an elliptical galaxy fraction (Fg = 0.70), a highly polarized blue component (FC1 = 0.15), a less polarized red component (FC = 0.09), and a contribution from the nebular continuum (0.06). Imaging polarimetry shows a double fan of polarization vectors with circular symmetry that corresponds to the ionization cone seen in Hubble Space Telescope images.

	abstract = {We investigate the total kinetic power (Lj) and age (tage) of powerful jets in FR II radio galaxies by comparison of the dynamical model of expanding cocoons with observations. We select four FR II radio sources (Cygnus A, 3C 223, 3C 284, and 3C 219), for which the mass-density profiles of the intracluster medium (ICM) are known in the literature. It is found that large fractions gtrsim0.02-0.7 of the Eddington luminosity (LEdd) are carried away as kinetic power of jets. The upper limit of estimated 2Lj/LEdd is larger than unity (lesssim10) for some sources, suggesting the possibility of super-Eddington mass accretions. As a consequence of the large powers, we also find that the total energy stored in the cocoon (Ec) exceeds the energy derived from the minimum energy condition for the energy of radiating nonthermal electrons and magnetic fields (Emin): 4 {\textless} Ec/Emin {\textless} 310. This implies that most of the energy in the cocoon is carried by invisible components such as thermal leptons (electron and positron) and/or protons.},

	abstract = {We report Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer and quasi-simultaneous Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) observations of the nearby, powerful radio galaxy Cygnus A, with the present paper focusing on the properties of the active nucleus. In the Chandra observation, the hard ({\textgreater}a few keV) X-ray emission is spatially unresolved with a size {\textless}{\textasciitilde}1" (1.5 kpc, H0=50 km s-1 Mpc-1) and coincides with the radio and near-infrared nuclei. In contrast, the soft ({\textless}2 keV) emission exhibits a bipolar nebulosity that aligns with the optical bipolar continuum and emission-line structures and approximately with the radio jet. In particular, the soft X-ray emission corresponds very well with the [O III] λ5007 and Hα+[N II] λλ6548, 6583 nebulosity imaged with Hubble Space Telescope. At the location of the nucleus, there is only weak soft X-ray emission, an effect that may be intrinsic or result from a dust lane that crosses the nucleus perpendicular to the source axis. The spectra of the various X-ray components have been obtained by simultaneous fits to the six detectors. The compact nucleus is detected to 100 keV and is well described by a heavily absorbed power-law spectrum with Γh=1.52+0.12-0.12 (similar to other narrow-line radio galaxies) and equivalent hydrogen column NH(nuc)=2.0+0.1- 0.2×1023cm-2. This column is compatible with the dust obscuration to the near-infrared source for a normal gas-to-dust ratio. The soft ({\textless}2 keV) emission from the nucleus may be described by a power-law spectrum with the same index (i.e., Γl=Γh), although direct fits suggest a slightly larger value for Γl. Narrow emission lines from highly ionized neon and silicon, as well as a ``neutral'' Fe Kα line, are detected in the nucleus and its vicinity (r{\textless}{\textasciitilde}2 kpc). The equivalent width (EW) of the Fe Kα line (182+40-54 eV) is in good agreement with theoretical predictions for the EW versus NH(nuc) relationship in various geometries. An Fe K edge is also seen. The RXTE observations indicate a temperature of kT=6.9+0.3-1.0 keV for the cluster gas (discussed in Paper III of this series) and cluster emission lines of Fe Kα and Fe Kβ and/or Ni Kα. We consider the possibility that the extended soft X-ray emission is electron-scattered nuclear radiation. Given that 1\% of the unabsorbed 2-10 keV nuclear radiation would have to be scattered, the necessary gas column [NH(scattering){\textasciitilde}=3.5×1022cm-2] would absorb the X-rays rather than scatter them if the gas is cold. Thus, the scattering plasma must be highly ionized. If this ionization is achieved through photoionization by the nucleus, the ionization parameter ξ{\textgreater}1 ergs cm s-1 and the electron density ne{\textasciitilde}=6cm-3 given the observed distance of the soft X-ray emission from the nucleus. The electron column density inferred from the X-ray observations is much too low to account for the extended optical scattered light, strongly suggesting that the polarized optical light is scattered by dust. The presence of highly ionized Ne lines in the soft X-ray spectrum requires 20ergscms-1{\textless}{\textasciitilde}ξ{\textless}{\textasciitilde}300 ergs cm s-1 these lines may originate closer to the nucleus than the extended soft continuum or in a lower density gas. A collisionally ionized thermal model of the extended soft X-rays cannot be ruled out but is unattractive in view of the low metal abundance required (Z=0.03Zsolar). The hard X-ray to far-infrared ratio for the nucleus of Cygnus A is similar to that seen in Seyfert 1 and unobscured radio galaxies. By means of the correlation between hard X-ray luminosity and nuclear optical absolute magnitude for these classes of object, we estimate MB=-22.4 for Cygnus A, near the borderline between Seyfert galaxies and QSOs.},

	abstract = {MARX is a portable ray-trace program that was originally developed to simulate event data from the trans- mission grating spectrometers on-board the Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO). MARX has since evolved to include detailed models of all CXO science instruments and has been further modified to serve as an event simulator for future X-ray observatory design concepts. We first review a number of CXO applications of MARX to demonstrate the roles such a program could play throughout the life of a mission, including its design and calibration, the production of input data products for the development of the various software pipelines, and for observer proposal planning. We describe how MARX was utilized in the design of a proposed future X-ray spectroscopy mission called ÆGIS (Astrophysics Experiment for Grating and Imaging Spectroscopy), a mission concept optimized for the 0.2 to 1 keV soft X-ray band. ÆGIS consists of six independent Critical Angle Transmission Grating Spectrometers (CATGS) arranged to provide a resolving power of 3000 and an effective area exceeding 1000 cm2 across its passband. Such high spectral resolution and effective area will permit ÆGIS to address many astrophysics questions including those that pertain to the evolution of Large Scale Structure of the universe, and the behavior of matter at very high densities. The MARX ray-trace of the ÆGIS spectrometer yields quantitative estimates of how the spectrometer’s performance is affected by misalignments between the various system elements, and by deviations of those elements from their idealized geometry. From this information, we are able to make the appropriate design tradeoffs to maximize the performance of the system.},

	abstract = {We present cosmological parameter constraints based on the final nine-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data, in conjunction with a number of additional cosmological data sets. The WMAP data alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a six-parameter ΛCDM model. When WMAP data are combined with measurements of the high-l cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the baryon acoustic oscillation scale, and the Hubble constant, the matter and energy densities, Ω b h 2, Ω c h 2, and ΩΛ, are each determined to a precision of {\textasciitilde}1.5\%. The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3\%, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5σ level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the end of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional ΛCDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their ΛCDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r {\textless} 0.13 (95\% CL); the spatial curvature parameter is limited to {\textbackslash}Omega \_k = -0.0027{\textasciicircum}\{+ 0.0039\}\_\{- 0.0038\}; the summed mass of neutrinos is limited to ∑m ν {\textless} 0.44 eV (95\% CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to lie within N eff = 3.84 ± 0.40, when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on N eff and the primordial helium abundance, Y He, agrees with the prediction of standard big bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent Planck measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe.},

	abstract = {We present the results from (1) imaging observations of Cygnus A in five essentially line-free continuum bands with central wavelengths ranging from 0.34 to 2.1 microns, (2) imaging observations in five narrowband filters centered on the emission lines Hβ, [O III] λ5007, Hα, [N II] λ6583, and [S II] λλ6716,6731, and (3) deep spectroscopy covering the entire central region of Cyg A. We confirm that the featureless spectrum component is to be identified with the prominent double morphology at the center of Cyg A, but uncertainties in the distribution of the dust in this region tend to limit the accuracy with which we can determine its morphology and spectral-energy distribution (SED). From regions that appear to be least affected by obscuration, we find fnu {\textasciitilde} ν{\textasciicircum}-0.1{\textasciicircum} for this component. This SED could be consistent with free-free emission, a population of young stars, or a quasar continuum scattered by electrons, but probably not with a quasar continuum scattered by dust, which would be bluer. Our spectroscopy places an upper limit on the equivalent width of broad Hβ that is well below that of typical quasars, showing that this flat-spectrum component (FSC) is almost certainly not dominated by scattered quasar radiation. Appeals to scattering by hot electrons to smear the scattered broad lines into invisibility appear to fail because the large density scale height of the electrons and the inefficiency of electron scattering should result in smoother and more extensive structure than we observe. Although the relative SED is consistent with free-free emission, the required amount of hot gas violates other observational constraints. At high angular resolution, the apparent morphology of the FSC is spiral-like. Although this impression may be partly due to obscuration, the distribution of the dust itself only serves to reinforce the spiral-like nature of the material with which it is associated. We conclude that the FSC is most likely radiation from a starburst at the center of Cyg A. Fits to the radial surface-brightness profile of the late-type component after our best efforts at removing the FSC allow us to estimate the wavelength dependence of extinction in the central region. A comparison with simple models for sources embedded in dust indicates that {\textasciitilde}50\% of the emergent blue flux from the late-type stars at the center may be due to scattered radiation. This large scattered contribution (which probably applies as well to the FSC and the emission-line component), together with a modest asymmetry in the radiation field, could plausibly account for the observed polarization properties of the inner region of Cyg A. Systematic differences are present between the distribution of [O III] on the one hand and [N II] (and other low-ionization species) on the other. After a large common component to the distribution is removed, the remaining [O III] excess is aligned with the radio axis, while the [N II] excess is distributed in what appears to be a planar structure perpendicular to the radio axis. The association of dust with this latter component indicates that it is a distinct morphological structure and not simply the result of shadowing effects. The emission-line intensities in the high-ionization regions are consistent with photoionization by a power-law continuum; those in the low-ionization region are similar to those seen in LINERs and appear to be consistent with ratios expected from x-ray photoionization. We find a systemic redshift for Cyg A of 0.05562+/-0.00015, from a measurement of the strongly diluted Mg I b feature in high-S/N spectra of the central region. The velocity field of the ionized gas is quite complex, showing at least two components along the line of sight in many regions. In general, discrete clouds show velocity curves consistent with rotation rather than with outflow, but high-velocity gas, probably associated with the radio jets, is seen on both sides of the galaxy nucleus. The ionized gas centered on the nucleus is counter-rotating relative to the bright cloud to the northwest and most of the fainter material in the same area. We conclude that, while there are strong reasons for believing that Cyg A harbors a hidden quasar (the presence of a point x-ray source, evidence from the emission lines of a flat photoionizing continuum, and the probable recent detection of scattered broad Mg II), there is no evidence that a significant amount of quasar optical or IR continuum has been scattered into our line of sight. Although the optical continuum peaks are roughly aligned with the radio structure, it is unlikely that there is any physical correspondence with the alignment between continuum and radio structure seen in luminous radio galaxies at high redshifts. Finally, the counter-rotating gas in the nuclear region, the secondary IR peak 1" north of the nucleus, the evidence for star formation in the nuclear mini-spiral, and the extensive ragged swath of low-ionization gas and dust stretching to the northeast and south all suggest that Cyg A has suffered a recent merger.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of the Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) observation of the intracluster gas associated with the cluster of galaxies surrounding Cygnus A. The dominant gaseous structure is a roughly elliptical (presumably prolate spheroidal in three dimensions) feature with semimajor axis {\textasciitilde}=1.1‧ ({\textasciitilde}=100 kpc). This structure apparently represents intracluster gas that has been swept up and compressed by a cavity inflated in this gas by relativistic material that has passed through the ends of the radio jets. The X-ray-emitting gas shows this prolate spheroidal morphology to {\textasciitilde}=1.2‧ (110 kpc) from the radio galaxy but is spherical on larger scales. The X-ray emission from the intracluster gas extends to at least 8' ({\textasciitilde}=720 kpc) from the radio galaxy, and a second, extended source of X-ray emission (probably associated with a second cluster of galaxies) is seen some 12' ({\textasciitilde}=1 Mpc) to the northwest of Cygnus A. The X-ray spectrum of the integrated intracluster gas imaged on the S3 chip (dimensions 8'×8'=720×720 kpc), excluding the contribution from the radio galaxy and other compact sources of X-ray emission, has a gas temperature, metallicity, and unabsorbed 2-10 keV rest-frame luminosity of 7.7 keV, 0.34 times solar, and 3.5×1044 ergs s-1, respectively. We have deprojected the X-ray spectra taken from 12 elliptical and circular annuli in order to derive a run of temperature, metallicity, density, and pressure as a function of radius. The temperature of the X-ray-emitting gas drops from {\textasciitilde}=8 keV more than 100 kpc from the center to {\textasciitilde}=5 keV some 80 kpc from the center, with the coolest gas immediately adjacent to the radio galaxy. ``Belts'' of slightly cooler ({\textasciitilde}=4 keV) X-ray-emitting gas run around the minor dimension of the cavity created by the radio source, while the limb-brightened edges of the cavity are slightly hotter ({\textasciitilde}=6 keV), perhaps as a result of heating by a bow shock driven by the probably expanding cavity into the intracluster gas. There is a metallicity gradient in the X-ray-emitting gas, with the highest metallicities ({\textasciitilde}solar) found close to the center, decreasing to {\textasciitilde}0.3 times solar in the outer parts. We have used the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium to derive a total cluster mass within 500 kpc of 2.0×1014Msolar and 2.8×1014Msolar for constant and centrally decreasing temperature profiles, respectively. The total mass of X-ray-emitting gas within the same radius is 1.1×1013Msolar. Thus, the gas fraction of the cluster within 500 kpc is 0.055 and 0.039 for the constant and centrally decreasing temperature profiles, respectively.},

We will discuss the lessons learned from the first six years of the software's evolution. Our initial approach to documentation evolved to concentrate on recipe-based "threads" which have proved very successful. A multi-dimensional abstract approach to data analysis has allowed new capabilities to be added while retaining existing interfaces. A key requirement for our community was interoperability with other data analysis systems, leading us to adopt standard file formats and an architecture which was as robust as possible to the input of foreign data files, as well as re-using a number of external libraries. We support users who are comfortable with coding themselves via a flexible user scripting paradigm, while the availability of tightly constrained pipeline programs are of benefit to less computationally-advanced users. As with other analysis systems, we have found that infrastructure maintenance and re-engineering is a necessary and significant ongoing effort and needs to be planned in to any long-lived astronomy software.},

	abstract = {The third iteration of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF3) is made up of 4536 quasars observed at S/X bands using very-long-baseline interferometry. These sources are high-redshift quasars, typically between 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2, that are believed to host active galactic nuclei at their centers. The position of compact radio sources can be determined better than sources with large amounts of extended radio structure. Here we report information on a series of 20 observations from 2017 January through December 2017 that were designed for precise astrometry and to monitor the structure of sources included in the ICRF3. We targeted 3627 sources over the one year campaign and found the median flux density of 2697 detected sources at S band is 0.13 Jy, and the median flux density of 3209 sources detected at X band is 0.09 Jy. We find that 70\% of detected sources in our campaign are considered compact at X band and ideal for use in the ICRF and 89\% of the 2615 sources detected at both frequencies have a flat spectral index, α {\textgreater} 0.5},

	abstract = {An iterative technique is described for generating estimates to the solutions of rectification and deconvolution problems in statistical astronomy. The technique, which derives from Bayes' theorem on conditional probabili- ties, conserves the constraints on frequency distributions (i.e., normalization and non-negativeness) and, at each iteration, increases the likelihood of the observed sample. The behavior of the technique is explored by applying it to roblems whose solutions are known in the limit of infinite sample size, and excellent results are obtained after a few iterations. The astronomical use of the technique is illustrated by applying it to the problem of rectifying distributions of v sin i for aspect effect; calculations are also reported illustrating the technique's possible use for correcting radio-astronomical observations for beam-smoothing. Application to the problem of obtaining unbiased, smoothed histograms is also suggested.},
